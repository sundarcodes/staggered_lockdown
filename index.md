# How can we have a staggered lockdown in India ?

### TL;DR (The Summary)

1. Choose 5 color code representing 5 days of the week from Monday to Friday.
2. Uniformly allocate a color code to each person in India (through aadhar number preferrably).
3. Allow only people to come out having the color code corresponding to day of the week (deviations in case of emergency discussed below).
4. Saturday and Sunday - complete lockdown

### The Details

1. Choose 5 color code representing 5 days of the week from Monday to Friday.

   - Monday - <span style="color:#2ecc71"> Green </span>

   - Tuesday - <span style="color:#9b59b6"> Violet </span>

   - Wednesday - <span style="color:#e67e22"> Orange </span>

   - Thurday - <span style="color:#3498db"> Blue </span>

   - Friday - <span style="color:#f1c40f"> Yellow </span>

2. Uniformly allocate a color code to each person in India (through aadhar number preferrably)

   We could devise a simple method to assign a color code to each person in India having a valid identity proof. Aadhaar is a good choice here as most of the Indians have an Aadhaar number and its all digital.

   Q: How could we intimate people of their assigned colour code ?

   > A: We could have the mAadhaar app enhanced to add this feature and have all Indians download this app. The app should show their colour code. In addition,we could also send an SMS with the color code

   Q: What if people are not able to download the app or receive the SMS ?

   > A: We could have a page added in the uiaadhar website for people to check their color code with their aadhar number. We could in the worst case have people get their color codes through a physical visit

3. Allow only people to come out having the color code corresponding to day of the week.

   Once people know their color code, they would be allowed to come out only on the day matching their color code. Let's take an example. If I have been assigned the color <span style="color:#e67e22"> orange </span>, I could come out only on Wednesdays for getting any of the work done. I am not supposed to go out on any other days.

   Q: How can we enforce this ?

   > Make it mandate for people to carry their aadhaar cards or mAadhaar app through which they can provide the necessary proof. Punish people coming out without a valid proof.

   Q: What if I don't have maadhaar app in my mobile, but I know my color code and I can go out ?

   > Please ensure you carry your physical aaddhar card. We can have the police/patrolling officers verify given your aadhaar number through facility provided using the uiaadhaar website.

   Q: What if I have an emergency situation (accident/pregnancy) and my color code does not allow me to go out ?

   > A: In this case you could activiate your emergency lifeline allowed to be used once per aadhaar and go out. You have to activate this through your mAadhaar app. If you activate this, you could provide this as a proof to the police/patrolling officer. In case you do not have maadhaar app and in case you are questioned by the police/patrolling officer, you could have officer activate this on your behalf, thereby giving you the license to come out. Remember you could use it one and only once, so use it only when the real need is.

4) Saturday and Sunday - complete lockdown


    Enforce complete lockdown on Saturdays and Sundays. A rest for the essenta

### Parting Comments

These are initial flow of thoughts with a pure objective to be part of safe India. I sincerely request Indian government to consider this idea to enforce a longer partial lock down and at the same manage show effectively to align with our Safe India mantra.
I am sure this idea can be effectively expanded, conceived and implemented when best of the Indian Government Administrative minds take in in their hands.

My trigger for this idea came when my father was discussing about how a small village in South Tamil Nadu (ariyalur) had enforced a similar governance of restricting people movement based on days of the week and it has zero cases of Corona (**Touchwood !!**).

Few other notes:

1. The color codes could be more than 5 depending on what proportion of people we want to come out in the streets. If it is made 10, then a person could come out only once in 10 days which would further curtail the spread.
2. The same color code could be adoped to the real heroes of the hours - the doctors, nurses, government officials as they could also work on a rotation basis and take good amount of rests a well
3. We could also have shops selling essential services to enfore the colour code check and not provide goods to people not following the color code
